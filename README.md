## About the Workshop Series

AI is reshaping how we interact with geographic data. AI models are increasingly capable of writing custom analysis code and are morphing from a source of advice to an agent capable of executing GIS commands directly on your computer. In the domain of imagery analysis, the open ecosystem of machine learning is producing ever more capable models for a variety of tasks like object detection and image classification. Remote sensing foundation models hold the promise of accelerating ML accuracy and text-vision models are making it possible to perform complex image analyis with text prompts. 


This technical series aims to give a broad overview of developments in GeoAI and demystify the jargon and concepts for researchers working with GIS/Remote Sensing tools. We will demonstrate a handful of emerging tools, all free and open-source, and provide the attendees with many resources to continue their own exploration. 


The series is **FREE** and open to all University of Arizona personnel and is tailored for graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty looking to expand their geospatial skills. Basic knowledge of scripting languages (i.e., python) and some prior geospatial experience will be helpful.

## Schedule Fall 2025

| Date |  Topic | Description |
| :--: | :--: | :-- |
| 09/02/2025   | [The Geospatial AI Landscape](https://github.com/ua-datalab/geospatial_2025/wiki/Session-1:-Geospatial-AI-Landscape) | Join us as we explore the convergence of GIS/Remote Sensing with AI and how this will lower technical barriers while being a force multiplier in geographic data analyis. 
|  09/09/2025   | [Hands-On with Coding Agents in QGIS and Earth Engine](https://github.com/ua-datalab/geospatial_2025/wiki/Session-2:-Coding-Agents-with-QGIS-and-Earth-Engine)  | The session will demonstrate two AI tools for autonomous geospatial analysis: <br/><br/> - Execute commands in QGIS with Anthropic's Claude <br/> - Generate analysis code in Earth Engine using Google's Gemini. <br/><br/> To follow along, please see the pre-session setup instructions [here].  |
|    09/16/2025 | [Hands-on End-to-End Deep Learning Workflow for Aerial Imagery Analysis](https://github.com/ua-datalab/geospatial_2025/wiki/Session-3:-Deep-Learning-Workflow-for-Aerial-Imagery-Analysis)  | This session will walk through a complete machine learning workflow from getting a pretrained model, to zero-shot predictions, to image labeling and training. Several open-source tools will be used including Data-to-Science, jupyter notebooks, pytorch, github, and Huggingface. <br/><br/> To follow along, please see the pre-session setup instructions [here]. |

## Terminology & Definitions

Understanding the key terms used throughout this report:

### Hyperparameters (Training Configuration)

**Batch Size**
- Number of training images processed together in one forward/backward pass through the neural network
- Smaller batches (8): More frequent weight updates, better gradient estimates, higher memory efficiency
- Larger batches (32): Faster training on GPU, more stable gradients, but may miss fine-grained patterns
- *Example:* Batch size 8 means the model looks at 8 image patches, calculates error, then updates its weights

**Epochs**
- One complete pass through the entire training dataset
- More epochs = more learning opportunities, but risk of overfitting (memorizing training data)
- *Example:* 15 epochs means the model sees every training image 15 times during learning

**Workers**
- Number of parallel CPU processes loading and preprocessing training data
- More workers = faster data loading, less GPU idle time
- Optimal number depends on CPU cores and I/O speed
- *Example:* 4 workers means 4 CPU threads simultaneously prepare images while GPU trains

**Patch Size**
- Dimensions (in pixels) of image chips fed to the model during training
- Larger patches: More spatial context, but require more memory
- Smaller patches: Better detail capture, more training samples from same image
- *Example:* Patch size 800 means each training image is 800×800 pixels

### Evaluation Metrics (Model Performance)

**IoU (Intersection over Union)**
- Measures overlap between predicted tree bounding box and ground truth box
- Formula: (Area of Overlap) / (Area of Union)
- Range: 0.0 (no overlap) to 1.0 (perfect match)
- **IoU Threshold 0.2** means predictions with ≥20% overlap count as correct detections
- *Example:* If predicted box covers 30% of true tree location, IoU might be 0.25 (above 0.2 threshold = correct)

**Box Precision**
- Proportion of predicted tree boxes that are actually correct (true positives)
- Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- Answers: "Of all the trees the model detected, what percentage were real trees?"
- *Example:* Precision 0.8123 = 81.23% of detected trees are genuine (18.77% are false alarms)

**Box Recall**
- Proportion of actual trees (ground truth) that the model successfully detected
- Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- Answers: "Of all the real trees in the image, what percentage did the model find?"
- *Example:* Recall 1.0 = 100% of real trees were detected (zero trees missed)

**F1 Score**
- Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics
- Formula: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- Useful when you care equally about false positives and false negatives
- *Example:* F1 = 0.8964 with precision=0.8123 and recall=1.0 means excellent overall detection performance

### Understanding the Precision-Recall Tradeoff

- **High Precision, Low Recall:** Model is conservative—only detects trees it's very confident about (misses some real trees)
- **Low Precision, High Recall:** Model is aggressive—detects most real trees but also flags many false positives
- **Perfect Recall (1.0):** Found every single real tree, but might have some false detections
- **Balanced (High F1):** Good at both finding real trees AND avoiding false alarms

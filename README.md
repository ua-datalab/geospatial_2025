## About the Workshop 
Step out of conventional GIS frameworks and discover the latest trends in geospatial data science where open tools, cloud technologies, and the proliferation of sensor data are innovating earth observation and environmental monitoring. 

Emphasizing open science and reproducible methods, this immersive hands-on workshop series will:

* Show you how to harness cloud computing platforms
* Demonstrate Deep Learning workflows for remoteley sensed imagery
* Introduce you to cloud-native formats
* Help you build geospatial analysis pipelines

Each workshop session is designed to be a discrete lesson where students will walk away with specific knowledge on a tool and resources to explore deeper. Our goal is to demystify vocabulary and show you how to use these tools with straight forward examples. We hope to cover material that is not currently being taught in credited classes at U of A.  

The series is **FREE** and open to all University of Arizona personnel and is tailored for graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty looking to expand their geospatial skills. Please [register here for the workshop](https://uarizona.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EwvE8pKzvNI9Mi)

We welcome students and professionals from any field of study across the university. A variety of skill levels are also welcome, though each lesson will assume the audience has limited experience on the topic. Basic knowledge of scripting languages (python/R) and some prior geospatial experience will be helpful. Some of the lessons will include gentle live coding, but the focus will be on the big picture of what the code is doing. Jupyter notebooks with pre-written python code will be provided for several of the lessons.

## Schedule Fall 2025

| Date |  Topic | Description |
| :--: | :--: | :-- |
| 09/10/24   | [Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/ua-datalab/Geospatial_Workshops/wiki/Google-Earth-Engine) | Join us as we introduce Google Earth Engine, a revolutionary cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. This workshop will show you how to access the platform, the basics of how to navigate the software, and tips for leveraging the massive data catalog. We will show you code examples, app examples, and point you to resources on how to learn more about the powerful tool. This is a must-know tool for geospatial data analysts!
|  09/17/24   | [Deep Learning for Aerial Imagery: DeepForest](https://github.com/ua-datalab/Geospatial_Workshops/wiki/Image-Object-Detection-‐-Deep-Forest)  | Have you wanted to get into geospatial deep learning but aren't sure how? This session demonstrates the use of the python library DeepForest for detecting trees (or birds) in high-resolution aerial imagery. DeepForest uses the powerful deep learning framework Pytorch, but reduces the complexity for researchers more focused on forestry and ecology. Using python code in a jupyter notebook, we will demonstrate workflows to run existing tree detection models, as well as how to fine-tune a model for your area of interest. An existed account with [Cyverse](https://cyverse.org/) is necessary to follow along in the jupyter notebook.  |
|    09/24/24 | [Deep Learning for Aerial Imagery: Detecto](https://github.com/ua-datalab/Geospatial_Workshops/wiki/Image-Object-Detection-‐-Detecto)  | In this session we will continue with deep learning object detection and show you a python library called Detecto that can help you train a CNN model to identify any object you wish in imagery. |
